# Prediction Scoring System Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive prediction scoring system that:

1. Allows admins to manage questions and their point values
2. Provides consistent scoring logic for evaluating predictions
3. Ensures that points are correctly assigned for accurate predictions
4. Makes all scoring rules transparent and predictable

## Components

### 1. Question Management in Admin Panel

- **New Admin UI**: Added a dedicated section in the Admin panel for question management
- **CRUD Operations**: Admins can create, read, update, and delete prediction questions
- **Point Values**: Each question has a configurable point value
- **Activation Control**: Questions can be marked as active or inactive to control availability
  - Questions are active by default
  - Inactive questions won't appear in prediction forms or be scored

### 2. Improved Scoring Logic

- **Clear Evaluation Rules**: Simplified evaluation logic for each question type
- **Consistent Scoring**: Points are directly tied to questions in the database
- **Default Questions**: Standard questions with sensible defaults are automatically created
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging throughout the evaluation process

### 3. Data Model Changes

- **Question Schema**: Updated to include points and active status
- **Standardized IDs**: Questions now use standardized IDs for reliable lookups
- **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

## How It Works

### Question Definition

Questions are stored in the Firestore `questions` collection with these fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., "winner", "top-batsman")
- `text`: The text shown to users (e.g., "Which team will win?")
- `type`: Category of question (e.g., "winner", "topBatsman")
- `points`: Number of points awarded for correct answers
- `isActive`: Whether the question is available for predictions (true by default)

### Standard Question Types

1. **Match Winner** (10 points)
   - Simple exact match comparison

2. **Top Batsman** (15 points)
   - Compares standardized player names

3. **Top Bowler** (15 points)
   - Compares standardized player names

4. **Highest Total** (10 points)
   - For questions like "Will total exceed 350 runs?"
   - Checks if the actual match total meets the prediction

5. **More Sixes** (10 points)
   - Compares which team hit more sixes

### Evaluation Process

1. When an admin updates match results, the system:
   - Loads all active questions with their point values
   - Retrieves all user predictions for the match
   - Evaluates each prediction against the actual results
   - Awards points based on the question's defined point value
   - Updates user records and leaderboards

2. The evaluation logic for each question type is clear and predictable:
   - No complex formulas or sliding scales
   - Either the prediction is correct (full points) or incorrect (zero points)
   - Only active questions are considered during evaluation

## Admin Usage

1. **Accessing Question Management**:
   - Go to the Admin Panel
   - Select the "Predictions" tab
   - Use the "Question Management" card at the top

2. **Adding a Question**:
   - Click "Add Question" tab
   - Select question type
   - Enter question text
   - Set point value
   - Toggle active status (active by default)
   - Click "Create Question"

3. **Editing Questions**:
   - Find the question in the list
   - Click the edit icon
   - Modify values as needed
   - Click save

4. **Disabling a Question**:
   - Find the question in the list
   - Click the edit icon
   - Set the status to "Inactive"
   - Click save
   - The question will no longer appear in prediction forms or be scored

## Future Enhancements

1. **Question Templates**: Pre-defined templates for common question types
2. **Question Groups**: Group related questions together
3. **Dynamic Point Values**: Adjust point values based on match importance
4. **Partial Points**: Award partial points for close predictions

## Technical Details

The implementation has been carefully structured to ensure:

1. **Performance**: Efficient batch updates to minimize database operations
2. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and reusable components
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new question types in the future
